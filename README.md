# 📄 [Open PDF Merger](https://open-pdf-merger.netlify.app) (Next.js + TypeScript)
I was making my resume and needed to merge two separate PDFs into one. Most solutions I found—Adobe Acrobat or online tools—either **cost money** or produced **low-quality results**.

So I built this: a **free PDF merging tool** that runs entirely in your browser.  
- 🔒 Files never leave your device.  
- 👀 Preview before downloading.  
- ✏️ Reorder and edit file order.  
- 📥 Download the merged PDF with one click.

## 🚀 Features

- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Drop multiple PDFs into the app.  
- **Reordering**: Move files up or down in the list.  
- **Preview**: View the merged PDF in a floating window before downloading.  
- **One-click Download**: Export the final merged file.  
- **100% Client-side**: No backend, no file uploads, no privacy concerns.
